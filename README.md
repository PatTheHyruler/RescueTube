Backend for a web application that archives content from online video platforms (currently only YouTube).


Started as a university homework project, the code for which can be found here:
* [Backend API + MVC frontend (ASP.NET Core)](https://github.com/mipaat/icd0021-22-23-s)
* [TypeScript frontends (React & Vue)](https://github.com/mipaat/icd0006-22-23-s)

Currently WIP copying and rewriting the original project.
